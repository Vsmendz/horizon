//! Nintendo Switch (Horizon OS) runtime for Horizon: the libnx lifecycle hooks, boot/exit
//! logging, crash handler, heap reporting and C shims the `aarch64-nintendo-horizon` target
//! needs, ported from bevy-horizon's `bevy_horizon` crate with the Bevy parts removed.
//!
//! Linking this crate is what makes an NRO work: its `#[no_mangle]` `userAppInit`/`userAppExit`,
//! `__wrap_threadCreate`/`__wrap_fchmod`/`__wrap_rename`/`__wrap_rmdir` (the target spec's
//! `--wrap=` pre-link args), `getrandom`/`_getentropy_r`/`sysconf`/`_init`/`_fini` and exception
//! handlers come from `compat`, and its `build.rs` adds the devkitA64 link-search paths and
//! `-lnx -lsysbase -lc -lm -lgcc` that nothing else in the Horizon graph emits.
//!
//! `init` runs the service setup (romfs, BSD sockets, applet focus mode) and starts the log
//! writer; call it first thing in `main`. `flush_logs` and `process_applet_messages` are for the
//! game loop (Phase 2); `software_keyboard` shows the system keyboard for text entry.
